# What is cloud

Cloud  it is  basically, as a rent computing resources or as service provider. The cloud refers to server that are accessed over the internet, and the software and data base that run on those servers. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software application on their own machine.
#### As a rent it provides :-
1. Computing resources

2. Software/Application

3. Pay as you go

## Advantages of cloud computing

- COMPUTER NETWORK

-  SERVICES

- APPLICATION

-  STORAGE(DATA BASE)

- SERVER 
## Disadvantages of cloud computing
-  Downtime. Downtime is often cited as one of the biggest disadvantages of cloud computing. Since cloud computing systems are internet-based.

- Security and privacy.

 ## Types of cloud computing?
 1. **Private cloud :-** Specific to organization/company. A private cloud is a cloud computing system in which IT services are supplied for the specialized use of one organization over private

IT facilities. A single organization operates the cloud infrastructure only. It can be run on-site or off-site by the organization or a third party. Private cloud terms are often employed interchangeably with the virtual private cloud (VPC).

Technically speaking, a VPC is a private cloud that uses the infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider, while an inner cloud is enforced.

**2. Public Cloud :-**  Enable to everyone

1.AWS

2.GCP

3.AZURE

The public cloud is described as computing services provided through the public internet by third-party suppliers, making them accessible to those who want to use them or buy them. It can be free or on-demand for customers to pay for the cycles, storage or  bandwidth they consume per usage.

**Example :-** Sun Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure.

**3.** **Hybrid Cloud :- private + public**

A hybrid cloud is a computer environment that incorporates a government and private cloud to share information and apps. Organizations achieve  flexibility and the computer capacity of a government cloud for fundamental and insensitive computing functions, whilst safe behind a corporate  firewall for business-critical apps and information.
